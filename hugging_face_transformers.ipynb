    "### What is a Transformer Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Transformer Model is a neural network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data, for example, words in a sentence. Transformer models apply an evolving set of mathematical techniques, called attention or self-attention, differently weighing the significance of each part of the input data. They are used primarily in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. Similarly to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential data, for example a body of text, with applications such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs, and therefore, reduces training times. The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pre-trained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer models were first described in a [2017 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkGuidedProjectsIBMGPXX0AIAEN102-2022-01-01) from Google, as the newest and the most powerful classes of models invented today, replacing some RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do Transformer Models do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer Models have many useful applications in today world. They are widely used in near real-time translation tasks, opening communication spaces to language-diverse and hearing-impaired audiences. These models are advancing medical research by helping scientists to understand the DNA and amino acid sequences to speed up the development and improve the quality of treatments for different diseases. The models can detect anomalies to prevent fraud detection, streamline manufacturing, make recommendations and overall improve our day-to-day quality of life.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is very easy way to apply Hugging Face Transformers, it is to use the `pipeline()` function. The pipeline makes it simple to use any model from the Hugging Face Hub for inference on any language, computer vision, speech, or multimodal tasks. Each task has an associated pipeline. However, it is simpler to use the general pipeline abstraction, which contains all the task-specific pipelines. The `pipeline()` automatically loads a default model and a pre-processing class capable of inference for any of your desired tasks.\n",

So, what is EDA and why is it important to perform it before we dive into any analysis?\n",
    "EDA is a visual and statistical process that allows us to take a glimpse into the data before the analysis. It lets us test the assumptions that we might have about the data, proving or disproving our prior believes and biases. It lays foundation for the analysis, so our results go along with our expectations. In a way, it’s a quality check for our predictions.\n",
    "As any data scientist would agree, the most challenging part in any data analysis is to obtain a good quality data to work with. Nothing is served to us on a silver plate, data comes in different shapes and formats. It can be structured and unstructured, it may contain errors or be biased, it may have missing fields, it can have different formats than what an untrained eye would perceive. For example, when we import some data, very often it would contain a time stamp. To a human it is understandable format that can interpreted. But to a machine, it is not interpretable, so it needs to be told what that means, the data needs to be transformed into simple numbers first. There are also different date-time conventions depending on a country (i.e., Canadian versus USA), metric versus imperial systems, and many other data features that need to be recognized before we start doing the analysis. Therefore, the first step before performing any analysis – is get really aquatinted with your data!\n",
    "This course will teach you to ‘see’ and to ‘feel’ the data as well as to transform it into analysis-ready format. It is introductory level course, so no prior knowledge is required, and it is a good starting point if you are interested in getting into the world of Machine Learning. The only thing that is needed is some computer with internet, your curiosity and eagerness to learn and to apply acquired knowledge.  If you live in Canada, you might be interested about gasoline prices in different cities or if you are an insurance actuary you need to analyze the financial risks that you will take based on your clients information. Whatever is the case, you will be able to do your own analysis, and confirm or disprove some of the existing information.\n",
    "The course contains videos and reading materials, as well as well as a lot of interactive practice labs that learners can explore and apply the skills learned. It will allow you to use Python language in Jupyter Notebook, a cloud-based skills network environment that is pre-set for you with all available to be downloaded packages and libraries. It will introduce you to the most common visualization libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to demonstrate various EDA techniques with some real-life datasets.\n",
